1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.340
Tools for evaluating web accessibility.

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:11.620
There are software programs and online services to help you identify accessibility barriers.

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.381
They can save you lots of time and effort
on evaluation,

4
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:18.480
and can help you avoid creating new accessibility barriers.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.210
However, tools can't do it all.

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.410
Some accessibility checks just cannot be automated
and require manual intervention.

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.599
Some tools guide you through the checks that
cannot be automated.

8
00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.340
Some tools check one page at a time, while
others can scan entire websites.

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.940
Tools can be integrated into different work environments.

10
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.699
For example, into your web browser, content
management system or CMS,

11
00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.139
and your development and deployment tools.

12
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.760
They support different roles in a project team,

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.170
such as content authors, code developers,  designers, and product owners.

14
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.809
Note that in some cases tools can provide
inaccurate results.

15
00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.145
So avoid relying too much on what tools say

16
00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:11.620
over addressing the real-life experience of website users.

17
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.820
"Selecting Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools"
explains what tools can and cannot do,

18
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.600
and what to look for in tools that meet your needs.

19
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.830
The list of web accessibility evaluation tools
has filters to help you find the right tool

20
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.800
for your particular situation.

21
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.511
Equipped with tools and knowledge on how to use them,

22
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:37.710
you are in good shape to find accessibility barriers more efficiently.

23
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.300
Web accessibility: essential for some, useful for all.

24
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:53.440
